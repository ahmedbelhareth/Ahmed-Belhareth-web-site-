    "description": "Currently, I am working as a software development analyst on a project called Nile. This project is linked to an external project named Chorus, which serves more than 9 clients and focuses on distributing financial information such as bond prices, rates, and coupons to client servers. This data primarily relates to financial products for clients in the insurance sector. The project is extensive and relies on legacy technologies like Sybase, Python, Java, as well as networking tools for server communication via SSH and MFT. Initially, I studied the documentation to understand the legacy solutions before transitioning to more modern technologies. I migrated Sybase components to Spring Boot and Java 17, adapting the old stored procedures to Java SQL. Additionally, I created temporary tables to preserve the old code while integrating a new, more innovative architecture. Furthermore, I developed JSON services to be consumed by a front-end interface built with Angular. Simultaneously, I am mentoring an intern who is working on the front-end development with Angular. My daily tasks involve maintenance, fixes, and implementing enhancements for managing the distribution of financial data. There are two types of distributions: dynamic distribution on client demand and nightly distribution of bond prices, rates, coupons, etc. Every morning, I verify the nightly distribution and correct any anomalies on the servers to ensure the smooth distribution of data, such as French Treasury bills (BTF), trading volumes, and so forth. I manage all environments: development, integration (testing), and production."
